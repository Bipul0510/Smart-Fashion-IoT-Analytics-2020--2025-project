📌 End-to-End Project: “Fashion IoT Analytics 2025”

1. Project Overview

Title: Smart Fashion IoT Analytics 2025
Objective: Analyze IoT-enabled fashion products (smart wearables, connected clothing, AR/VR shopping experiences, RFID-enabled inventory) to extract trends, optimize operations, and predict customer behavior.

Use Case Areas:

* Smart wearables (health + fashion devices)   

* RFID-based inventory management

* IoT-based personalized shopping (smart mirrors, AR fitting rooms)

* Sustainability tracking (carbon footprint monitoring of fashion items)



2. SQL Problem Statements (fashion_iot_queries.sql)

* Find top 5 cities where IoT fashion devices are most popular.

* Calculate average carbon footprint reduction per product.

* Identify repeat customers who used IoT features > 5 times.

* Compare sales growth (2020–2025) of Smartwatches vs IoT Sneakers.

* Segment customers by connectivity preference (WiFi vs 5G vs Bluetooth).



3. Python Analytics (fashion_iot_analysis.py)

* Import CSV data with pandas.

* Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on IoT fashion adoption trends.

* Use Matplotlib / Seaborn for: Sales trend by year (2020–2025).

* IoT feature adoption vs non-IoT products.

* Customer demographics (Age, Gender) vs IoT device purchases.

* Build a Predictive Model (Regression/Classification):

* Predict if a customer will buy an IoT-enabled fashion product.

* Output insights into visual dashboards.
